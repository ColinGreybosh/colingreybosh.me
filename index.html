                    <p style="order: 0">My name is Colin Greybosh, and I am an aspiring programmer and hobbyist web designer from Pennsylvania. Currently in high school, courses I am taking include Java and AP Calculus, while last semester I finished a course on digital design and web design.</p>

                    <h2 style="order: -1">Welcome to my website!</h2>

                    <p>Although I am learning Java in school, I have been teaching myself C++ for a couple years. In my opinion, nothing worth of mention was created with my knowledge of C++, but learning C++ or even learning programming in general has really enhanced my understanding of math and breaking tasks down into small, manageable pieces.</p>

                    <p>I have been participating in the Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science since 8<sup>th</sup> grade. Up to the present, I had always entered projects into the physics category and taken second place in regionals; however, my first presentation I entered into computer science earned me a first award. Based on the Chudnovsky algorithm for calculating Pi, I created a program that tests the speed and accuracy differences between double-precision and arbitrary-precision arithmetic. As it was my first year competing in computer science, it was a bit daunting to step in front of judges and present, but I persevered and was pleasantly surprised at the result.</p>

                    <p>There is a collection of different projects I am working on posted on my <a href="https://github.com/ColinGreybosh" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with Java-related content from my current class to come soon. I would love constructive criticism if anybody happens to take a look!</p>
