                    <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>

                    <p>My name is Colin Greybosh, and I am a student at the Hazleton Area Academy of Sciences and an aspiring programmer/hobbyist 
                        web designer from Pennsylvania. Currently a senior high school, courses I will be taking include Honors Calculus III and Java II, 
                        while last semester I finished courses such as AP Calculus AB and Java I.</p>

                    <p>Although I am learning Java in school, I have been teaching myself C++ for a couple years. A couple projects include 
                        research for my last entry in the Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science and a currently unfinished game. Learning 
                        C++ and learning programming in general has really enhanced my understanding of math along with my problem solving skills.</p>

                    <p>I have been participating in the Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science since 8th grade. Up to the present, 
                        I had always entered projects into the physics category and taken second place in regionals; however, my first 
                        presentation I entered into computer science earned me a first award. Based on the Chudnovsky algorithm for 
                        calculating Pi, I created a program that tests the speed and accuracy differences between double-precision and 
                        arbitrary-precision arithmetic. As it was my first year competing in computer science, it was a bit daunting to 
                        step in front of judges and present, but I persevered and was pleasantly surprised at the result.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since I never received a first award before, it was my also first time going to the Penn State campus at State 
                        College to compete. My perseverance paid off though; I was given a first award with a perfect score along with 
                        an excellence recognition prize. After having the opportunity to travel to State College and experience the 
                        PJAS state competition, I must say that I am happy that the past three years of receiving second place did not 
                        dissuade me from trying.</p>

                    <p>There is a collection of different projects I am working on posted on my 
                        <a href="https://github.com/ColinGreybosh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Colin Greybosh</a> Github account  
                        with Java-related content from my current class to come soon. I would love constructive criticism if anybody 
                        happens to take a look!</p>
