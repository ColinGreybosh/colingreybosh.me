            <p>My name is Colin Greybosh, and I am a student at the Hazleton Area Academy of Sciences and an aspiring programmer/hobbyist 
                web designer from Pennsylvania. Currently a senior high school, I am taking classes such as Intro to Engineering Design and am enrolled in
                Honors Calculus III and Java II, while last year I completed courses such as AP Calculus AB and Java I.</p>

            <p>Although I am learning Java in school, I have been teaching myself C++ for a couple years. A couple projects include research for my 
                last entry in the Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science and a zero-player game that is currently in development. Learning C++ and
                programming in general has really enhanced my understanding of math along with my problem-solving skills.</p>

            <p>I have been participating in the Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science since 8th grade. Up to the present, 
                I had always entered projects into the physics category and taken second place in regionals; however, my first 
                presentation I entered into computer science earned me a first award. Based on the Chudnovsky algorithm for 
                calculating Pi, I created a program that tests the speed and accuracy differences between double-precision and 
                arbitrary-precision arithmetic. As it was my first year competing in computer science, it was a bit daunting to 
                step in front of judges and present, but I persevered and was pleasantly surprised at the result.</p>
            
            <p>Since I never received a first award before, it was my also first time going to the Penn State campus at State 
                College to compete. My perseverance paid off though; I was given a first award with a perfect score along with 
                an excellence recognition prize. After having the opportunity to travel to State College and experience the 
                PJAS state competition, I must say that I am happy that the past three years of receiving second place did not 
                dissuade me from trying.</p>

            <p>There is a collection of different projects I am working on posted on my 
                <a href="https://github.com/ColinGreybosh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Colin Greybosh</a> Github account  
                with Java-related content from my current class to come soon. I would love constructive criticism if anybody 
                happens to take a look!</p>
